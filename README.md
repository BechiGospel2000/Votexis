# Votexis: Decentralized Governance Framework

## Overview

Votexis is a governance framework enabling token holders to propose, vote, and execute changes to protocol parameters. It supports on-chain proposals, delegation, voting power snapshots, and execution of approved tasks.

## Features

* Proposal creation with deposits and thresholds
* Configurable governance parameters through system settings
* Categories for proposals: parameter, upgrade, fund, text
* Voting with support, opposition, and abstention tracking
* Delegation of voting power to another principal
* Proposal lifecycle: draft, active, passed, rejected, executed, canceled
* Execution delay before enacting passed proposals
* Task system for parameter updates, fund transfers, and contract calls
* Transparent vote records and proposal status queries

## Data Structures

* **system-parameters**: Protocol parameters with values, types, and descriptions
* **governance-proposals**: Proposals with metadata, lifecycle, and thresholds
* **proposal-tasks**: Actions tied to proposals for execution upon approval
* **vote-records**: Records of votes with choice, power, and optional comments
* **voting-delegations**: Delegation of voting rights to another address

## Key Functions
